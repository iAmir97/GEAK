// terminal API errors to null but NOT an indefinite hang. So bound every agent()
// call: if it has not returned after AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS, resolve it to null (which
// every .filter(Boolean)/null-check downstream already tolerates) and let the
// round proceed. VERY generous default (60min): a true hang never returns, so this only fires on a
// hang, NEVER on a legitimately-long agent. Inner agents include benchmark/profile/verify that build
// (hipcc/ninja) and run benches — minutes, well under 60min — plus the LLM-heavy optimize engineers
// (the ones observed hanging). A too-short bound would kill legit long agents (e.g. a slow rocprof or
// build), so keep it large. Cache keys (prompt, opts) are unchanged so resume still works. Falls back
// to raw agent() if setTimeout is unavailable. args.agent_timeout_ms=0 disables.
// API-FAULT TOLERANCE: a transient API failure (gateway 4xx/5xx, rate-limit, dropped connection, the
// model API going down mid-run) must NOT crash the whole workflow. agentT retries the call up to
// AGENT_RETRIES times on a thrown API/agent error, then resolves to null (every .filter(Boolean)/
// null-check downstream — incl. the Director validate + final report — already degrades on null rather
// than exiting). A timeout (hang) resolves null immediately and is NOT retried (a real hang would just
// burn another full timeout window). args.agent_retries tunes the count. If the failure is PERSISTENT
