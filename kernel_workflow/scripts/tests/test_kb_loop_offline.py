"""The warm-start loop, end to end, with no GPU and no network.

A lane's use of the experience KB is a cycle, and every piece of it is tested elsewhere in
isolation. What is only visible when the pieces run in order is whether the cycle CLOSES:

    read a key -> pick the top candidates -> land one on a workspace that does not match the
    layout it was recorded from -> optimize further on top of it -> write the result back under
    the same key -> read it again and get the improvement, not the starting point.

The one link this cannot cover is the measurement, which needs a card. Everything on either side
of it is here, so a regression in the plumbing fails in CI rather than half an hour into a run.
