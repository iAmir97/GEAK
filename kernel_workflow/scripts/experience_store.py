"""Local experience store for the kernel workflow — the machine-produced KB that carries the diff.

Self-contained, stdlib + PyYAML only, so a lane agent can call it over Bash. On-disk layout
(rooted at --root, default <repo>/kb_artifacts):

    <root>/<gfx>/<kernel_class>/<slug>/<exp_id>/
        meta.yaml     # identity + metric + prose pointers
        patch.diff    # the winning diff (verbatim copy)
        report.md     # optional tech_lead report, copied for prose

    slug = <canon(kernel_name)>__<language>__<gfx>   # deterministic; read and write derive it identically

Subcommands:
    write      Store one measured win behind the gate (missing_arch / no_improvement / empty_diff).
    resolve    Rank the top-N same-gfx solutions for a slug and mirror their prose into <refs-dir>.
    remap      Rewrite a stored patch's paths onto the calling workspace's layout, or refuse and say why.
    languages  Which languages a kernel has a page in — the store, not a task_type guess, decides.
    backfill-content
               Bring imported entries up to the current content shape (dry-run unless --apply).
    export-remote
               Render entries as KB Store candidates (one JSON line each); uploads nothing.
    resolve-remote
               `resolve`, but addressed by canonical id against a KB store (kb/store_local.py).
    write-remote
               `write`, landing the same result in the local store AND under its key.
    attest / attest-remote
               Count one attempt to USE a stored entry (validated | failed | not_reproduced), so a
               later curation pass can retire what nobody can reproduce. Moves no speedup, no rank.

Speedups only compare within one GPU arch, so resolve drops cross-arch entries outright. Neither
command ever raises: on failure it prints a JSON reason and exits 0 so the caller degrades.

resolve serves a CURATED top-N, not the raw speedup order: entries the curation retired
(`retained: false`) are never offered, near-ties below `--min-speedup` are not worth a verify slot,
and only one entry per `direction:` is ranked (same-idea runners-up ride along as `alternates`,
since they verify or fail together). A speedup only means something against its own
`metric.bench_key`, so each candidate carries one plus a `comparable` flag against rank 1.

# --- remote KB export -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Record shape mirrors KernelForge's (knowledge/kernel_identity.py and
# rewrite_by_flydsl/{identity,agent_kb,record_store}.py @ baabdae); the ADDRESS does not, and
# kb/identity.py owns it for both workflows and says why. Read and write must both go through it:
# the store finds nothing if the two sides disagree by one segment, and there is no error to notice
# — a mistyped dimension just reads as a cold start.
#
# The scheme is `geak:`, not `kernel:`, because our credential is scoped to `geak` identities and
# 403s on both `kernel:` and `inference:`. That scheme is client-defined and exact-lookup only, so
# every dimension has to be something the READ side can recompute from what it already knows;
# nothing may be derived from run-local state. Two consequences worth having in view here:
#
#   * the serving framework (vllm / sglang), its version and the numeric precision are NOT
#     dimensions, even though an e2e run knows all three. kernel_lane.js does not — it has no
#     upstream awareness at all, and pass-through from e2e forwards only `target_language`. A
#     dimension the reader cannot reconstruct is a permanent silent 404. They ride in
#     `value.upstream` instead, where a client can filter on them; precision is additionally
#     already spelled into most kernel names (`fused_moe_int4_w4a16`, `_w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm`)
#     so keying on it would double-encode and split those pages.
#   * every write publishes to BOTH rungs of kernel_canonical_ids(). The service does no prefix
#     aggregation, so the version-agnostic page exists only because we put records there.
