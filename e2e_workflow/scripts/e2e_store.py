"""Warm start and write-back for the e2e serving lane, over the same two planes as the kernel lane.

    e2e_store.py identity --model Qwen3-397B --gfx gfx950 --framework vllm \
        --framework-version 0.26.0 --precision mxfp8 --tp 8 --isl 1024 --osl 1024 --conc 64
    e2e_store.py resolve  ... --plane remote --refs-dir REFS --cache-dir CACHE
    e2e_store.py write    ... --plane both --store DIR --result run.json --apply

`resolve` answers the question the e2e Director asks at Setup — "has anyone already tuned this
deployment, and what did they land on" — and `write` is what makes the next run's answer non-empty.
Addresses come from `kb.identity.e2e_canonical_ids`, never from string formatting here, because a
reader and a writer that disagree by one segment do not raise: the run just cold starts.

WHAT AN E2E RECORD IS FOR, and why it is not a kernel record with different fields. A kernel entry
offers a patch to apply. An e2e entry mostly offers a CONFIG — env flags, server args, a launch
script — plus a list of kernels that turned out to be worth overlaying. The patch is optional and
often absent (a config-only win is a real win), so `resolve` never treats a missing artifact as a
broken record the way the kernel lane does.

THE THREE RUNGS ANSWER THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. They are not a fallback chain that happens to have
three links; each one is the correct page for a different ask, which is why all three are always
written:

    ...:mxfp8:tp_8:isl_1024:osl_1024:conc_64   "tune THIS benchmark point"
    ...:mxfp8:tp_8                             "given TP=8, how do I configure the server"
    ...:mxfp8                                  "how many ways should I shard this model at all"

Only the last one can compare TP4 against TP8, because that comparison needs them filed together.

READS AND WRITES RANK ON DIFFERENT METRICS, deliberately, and the split is the one thing to keep
straight in this file:

  * READING (`resolve`) orders every rung by absolute `throughput_tok_s`, high to low. That is what
    a Director asking "what should I run" wants on every page, including the coarse ones: it is
    choosing a config to spend a server launch on, and the fastest observed deployment is the
    honest first offer. The coarse rungs' numbers were measured at other workload points and are
    NOT comparable to this run's baseline — `_render_reference` says so in as many words — but a
    speedup ordering there is not more comparable, it just hides the incomparability behind a
    ratio. `--sort-by speedup` restores the old ordering for a caller that wants it.
  * WRITING (`write`) keeps the per-rung champion metric from `rung_metric()`: throughput on the
    exact rung, speedup on the coarser ones. The champion pointer is a promotion gate, not a
    display order, and a coarse page promoting on absolute tokens/sec would crown whichever
    workload point happens to be cheapest rather than whichever run improved anything.

Both scalars are written flat at the top of every document (the service's `sessions/top?metric=`
reads a top-level scalar and rejects a nested path), which is what lets a read rank on one while
the champion is kept on the other without a second write.

No delete exists on the service. Every `--apply` is permanent.

    """How much this record's number should be believed, recorded AT WRITE TIME.

    A reader cannot recover this later. `validation_status` alone does not answer it — a record can
    say `validated_win` and still be a number nobody checked for output parity, and the two are
    indistinguishable once the run's logs are gone. So the judgement is made here, once, by the
    process that still has the evidence, and stored as a first-class field:

      * `validated` — did this number clear a real gate on the box that produced it. False is a
        perfectly good answer and does NOT mean the record is worthless; it means a reader should
        re-measure before quoting it. A parity of `n/a` is false, not true: "we did not check" is
        not "we checked and it was fine".
      * `validation_basis` — WHICH gate. `hot_ab` is the Director's same-session interleaved A/B
        (the strong one). `cold_gate` is a fresh-server before/after (weaker: it carries the drift
        between two launches). `unverified` is a number that was reported but never independently
        reproduced. These are not comparable, so a reader that mixes them must at least know it is.
      * `parity` — pass | fail | n/a, verbatim. A faster server that answers differently is a
        regression, and this is the only field that says whether anyone looked.
      * `lifecycle` — `active` (believed) or `candidate` (recorded, unproven). The third value,
        `retracted`, is written only by kb/retract.py and never by a fresh write.
      * `retained` — the curation flag both lanes' readers filter on. True at birth; retraction
        flips it. Written explicitly rather than left absent so `retained is False` stays a
        three-state test (true / false / never stated) instead of degrading to a falsy check.

    Every field is overridable from the CLI because the caller sometimes knows better than the
    result JSON — a backfill from an old run has evidence this function cannot see, and forcing it
    to fake a `validation_status` to get the right state would corrupt the field that means
    something else.

        duplicated bytes and it goes stale, but it is the only copy that cannot 404 — an e2e record
        whose kernel references have rotted still reproduces the configuration it is claiming.

def _pack_overlay(dirpath: str) -> str:
    """`final_overlay`'s directory -> a .tar.gz of the overlay mechanism, or "" if it is not one.

    `final_overlay` names a DIRECTORY, always: the mechanism is a sitecustomize.py plus the modules
    it swaps in, and no single file carries it. _artifact_files() used to take only
    `os.path.isfile`, so that directory was dropped without a word and no e2e record ever carried
    an overlay — the runs that cleared _repro()'s reproducibility gate were the ones that also
    happened to emit a kernel patch, and a pure-overlay win could not be recorded at all.

    Only the mechanism goes in: the manifest, the sitecustomize.py that installs it, and the code
    the manifest names. The manifest names it two different ways and BOTH have to be packed. A
    `modules` entry replaces a whole upstream module and points at a file under `_patched/`. A
    `rebinds` entry leaves the module alone and swaps one symbol for `impl_module`'s — a sibling
    package or .py file at the overlay's top level, NOT under `_patched/`. Packing only `_patched/`
    silently produced a tarball with a manifest that rebinds to an import that is not in it: the
    gpt-oss-120b `_fwd_kernel` win is a `rebinds` overlay whose entire HIP kernel lives in
    `geak_hip_extend/`, and the record would have promised a reproducible run and shipped nothing
    to reproduce it with.

    An accepted-candidate directory also holds the A/B evidence it was judged on (`cand/`, `ref/`,
    server logs, profiles) — that is how the number was arrived at, not how it is reproduced, and
    it is several times the size of what a reader needs. `__pycache__` is skipped: a .pyc is stale
    the moment the reader's interpreter differs. `.torch_ext/` is skipped for the same reason one
    step further along: it is a torch cpp_extension BUILD cache (ninja logs, .o, a gfx-specific
    .so) that the reader's own load() rebuilds from the .hip source that is packed.

    Everything is packed under a single `overlay/` top level so the reader can untar into the
    bundle root and get one predictable directory to point PYTHONPATH at (see _launch_text).

    No manifest means this is not an overlay directory. Returning "" then is deliberate — the gate
    refuses the record rather than have it promise a tarball of something nobody can install.
