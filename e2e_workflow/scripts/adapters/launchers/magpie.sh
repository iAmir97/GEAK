# Magpie server LAUNCHER adapter for bench_e2e.sh.  Sourced (not executed).
# BACKEND-AGNOSTIC: one adapter serves every backend Magpie ships a script for
# (sglang, vllm, ...), because Magpie standardised the server-phase contract:
#   MAGPIE_RUN_PHASE=server  ->  launch server, wait ready, write pid to
#   MAGPIE_SERVER_PID_FILE, disown, exit 0.  Reads MODEL/TP/PORT/RESULT_DIR/
#   SERVER_LOG/PROFILE.  The only per-backend differences follow a REGULAR naming
#   rule, so they are derived from $BACKEND (never hard-coded per backend):
#     * extra server flags var : EXTRA_<BACKEND_UPPER>_ARGS  (EXTRA_SGLANG_ARGS / EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS)
#     * torch-profiler dir  var : <BACKEND_UPPER>_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR
#
# Redefining ONLY adapter_launch makes the served stack BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
# orchestrator's baseline (mem-fraction, --disable-radix-cache / gpu-mem-util,
# --trust-remote-code, *_USE_AITER, firmware-gated HSA_NO_SCRATCH_RECLAIM, ... all
# owned by that one script). The authored-kernel OVERLAY is prepended to
# PYTHONPATH HERE (Magpie's own path never honors OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH), so
# recipe-parity AND overlay application coexist.
#
# Script resolution (general): $MAGPIE_LAUNCH_SCRIPT, else the per-backend
# $MAGPIE_<BACKEND_UPPER>_SCRIPT. Its sibling benchmark_lib.sh / server_cleanup.sh
# must be present next to it. When no script is resolvable it DELEGATES to the
# native backend launch (adapter_launch_native), so a misconfigured run degrades
# instead of failing hard.
#
# bench_e2e.sh contract: sets global SERVER_PID; writes $LOG. Reads env:
#   BACKEND MODEL TP PORT GPU EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS EXTRA_ENV OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH
#   PROFILE PROFILE_DIR LOG OUT_DIR MAX_MODEL_LEN PROFILE_MAX_ITERS
#   PROFILE_DELAY_ITERS.
#
# TWO logs, deliberately: Magpie's script redirects the server with a
# TRUNCATING '> $SERVER_LOG', so anything this adapter appended to the same file
# would be destroyed the moment the server starts, and the script's own set -x
# trace would interleave with server output in whatever survived. The script's
# stdout/stderr therefore goes to magpie_launch.log and $LOG stays exclusively
# the server's, which is also what makes $LOG parseable for the kernel-selection
# fingerprint in result.json.serving_stack.
# adapter_health is inherited from the BACKEND adapter (curl $BASE_URL/health),
# which works regardless of who launched the server, so it is NOT redefined.

  # (vllm 0.26+ self-stops the profiler after N worker steps). Its buffer fills

  # Map GEAK's env onto Magpie's server-phase env. Ordering IS the precedence

  # earlier one and nothing GEAK sets can be silently displaced by the recipe.

  #
  #   * Outer ROCR already set (GEAK CI via run_local.sh: docker
  #     -e ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7 while /dev/dri is fully passed through).
  #     ROCr has already sliced the physical set and renumbered it 0..N-1, so
  #     $GPU is a LOGICAL index into that slice. Re-writing ROCR=$GPU would
  #     index the FULL physical set (logical 0..3 -> physical 0..3) and land on
  #     cards this job was never given. Keep the inherited ROCR and stack HIP
  #     on top (HIP masks after ROCr renumbering). Re-assert the outer ROCR
  #     AFTER $EXTRA_ENV so an accepted-env leak cannot clobber the mask.
  #
  #   * No outer ROCR (bare Magpie / whole-box Hyperloom). $GPU is PHYSICAL.
  #     Pin with ROCR alone and clear HIP/CUDA: Magpie's script derives the
  #     logical HIP range only while HIP is unset, and a HIP=PHYSICAL overlay
  #     on top of ROCR would index past the renumbered list (ROCR=2 -> device 0,
  #     HIP=2 -> OOB).
