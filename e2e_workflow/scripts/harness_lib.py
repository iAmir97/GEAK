"""Shared harness measurement library for GEAK e2e kernel tasks.

This is the SINGLE source of truth for how an isolated kernel task measures speedup and checks
correctness. Both the shared bake-off (`op_bench.py`) and every per-task `unittest.py` the Kernel
Extractor generates MUST import these helpers instead of hand-rolling a timing loop / correctness
check. Vendored (copied) into each `<short_name>_task/` at extract time so the task stays
self-contained + immutable + sha-checkable.

It exists to close two systematic "isolated win / e2e loss" holes that a naive per-op harness has:

(a) DEPLOYMENT-REPRESENTATIVE TIMING — score device work, not host launch/dispatch overhead, and read
    memory-bound kernels COLD from HBM like the live server does.
    The classic exploit: time the launcher in a tight `for _ in range(50): fn(); sync()` wall-clock loop.
    For decode shapes (small M) the wall clock is floored by per-call Python dispatch, NOT the GEMM. A
    candidate then wraps the op in a CUDA graph and `graph.replay()` — collapsing a dispatch floor that
    in the LIVE server is ALREADY gone (decode runs inside the server's own CUDA graph). Result: a huge
    isolated "speedup" that evaporates on integration.
    Fix: `time_op` scores CUDA-EVENT DEVICE time (the GPU timeline between two events), which excludes
    host launch/dispatch entirely — so collapsing dispatch buys nothing and no `inner` amortization is
    needed (inner=1). WALL time is measured alongside as a reference only. It also FLUSHES the last-level/
    Infinity cache before each sample so a memory-bound decode kernel reads its weights cold from HBM,
    matching deployment (the model working set >> cache, evicted between decode steps). `graph=True` times
    a captured-graph replay (the exact decode deployment context) with the same event+flush method.

(b) MULTI-ACCESS CORRECTNESS + AMDAHL SANITY.
    - `check_correct_multi` runs several DISTINCT-input cases, keeps ALL returned tensors live, and
      only THEN compares each to its oracle. A candidate that returns a persistent/shared `static_out`
      buffer (the graph-replay shortcut) is caught: the later call overwrites the earlier return, so
      the earlier comparison fails. It also asserts distinct output storage + no cross-call mutation
      (`assert_independent_outputs`). A launcher whose contract is "callable(args) -> fresh out" must
      not alias.
    - `amdahl_ceiling` / `amdahl_check` bound the e2e delta a kernel at `pct_gpu` GPU-time can produce
      given its isolated speedup. `amdahl_ceiling` is surfaced by op_bench as `amdahl_ceiling_e2e_pct`
      so the isolated bake-off already reports the MAX plausible e2e win. `amdahl_check` is the verdict
      form (observed-vs-ceiling) available to any downstream e2e comparison; an observed delta far above
      the ceiling is box drift / measurement error, not the kernel.

# actually runs. Synthesis itself is fine (perf is value-independent; the oracle is a high-precision

# (scripts/parse_regime.py output), so operand dtype, quant form, scales, and the paged-KV inner
# factor `x` all follow online. Everything below derives from element sizes + the parsed regime
# fields, so a new dtype / quant scheme needs no new branch. Torch-free for the pure derivations
# (dtype string math), so tests can assert them on a CPU-only / no-torch box.

# KV/operand dtypes (fp8*, int8) that need scales and pack x=16 into a 16-byte vector. All fp8 variants

    that single draw misses (masking, NaN/denormal handling, accumulation across magnitudes) by using the
    real production kernel as the truth source for each fresh draw — no stored golden needed.

    CORRECTNESS is a HARD GATE: for every shape × every draw, `correct(candidate_out, baseline_out, tol)`
    must pass, else `all_ok=False`. The baseline output is snapshotted (clone) BEFORE the candidate runs,
    so a candidate that aliases the baseline's storage (or returns a shared/static buffer) is caught.
    SPEEDUP is REPORT-ONLY: `baseline_ms / current_ms` per draw is recorded as a secondary robustness
    signal (value-independent perf variance / cliff detection), NOT the win metric — the primary metric
    stays the workload-weighted oracle speedup. Both times are `time_op` DEVICE time (CUDA events), taken
    with the L2/Infinity cache flushed cold before each iteration; `inner=1` (one launch per event window)
    since events time the GPU timeline directly — no host-side amortization loop is needed.

    `baseline_call(args) -> out` is the LEGACY in-process form, kept for op_bench / single-process tasks.

    `shapes` is a list of {"sig": <label>, "make_inputs": callable(rng) -> args}. `make_inputs` builds a

    """`per_case` for `serving_weighted_speedup`, one bucket per FRESH subprocess per leg.

    Fresh-per-bucket is not optional: a warm interpreter shares JIT/autotune state between the legs and
    reports a pseudo-1.0x that is an artifact, not a measurement.

    But fresh-per-bucket is also what makes ONE pair per bucket too coarse: fresh-process variance is
    exactly the variance `time_op`'s in-process repeats cannot average away. Measured on gfx950 it is
    ~0.1-0.5% on a prefill bucket and up to ~14% on a small-M decode bucket — so a real 1.05x candidate
    sits inside the noise of a single unpaired pair, which is the resolution the direction fix needs and
    did not have.

    Two things fix that, and only one of them costs anything:

    - INTERLEAVE. Each rep is a B,C PAIR, never all Bs then all Cs. Any drift over the sweep (clocks,
      thermals, a neighbour on the box) then lands on both legs and cancels, instead of accruing to
      whichever leg ran later. This is free — same subprocess count.
    - REPEAT, BUT ONLY WHEN IT MATTERS. `max_reps` pairs is the CEILING, not the plan. After each pair
      the running median ratio is checked: once it is outside `undecided`, the verdict cannot plausibly
      flip and the bucket stops. A 2.3x bucket costs one pair, exactly as before; a 1.05x bucket — the
      one whose answer is in doubt — spends the full budget. Flat `reps=3` would have tripled the cost
      of every bucket to buy resolution on the few that need it, and this path already pays a cold
      torch import per subprocess.

    `baseline_ms`/`optimized_ms` are the MEDIAN over the pairs actually run, so one unlucky process
    cannot carry the bucket. `reps` and `speedup_spread` (per-pair speedup range / median, 0.0 for a
    single pair) ride along so a wide bucket is visible downstream rather than averaged into silence."""
