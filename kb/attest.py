"""Attestation: counting what happened when a stored record was actually TRIED on a box.

A record's `validated` flag is a judgement its own writer made about its own measurement, once, at
write time. It answers "did the run that produced this number clear a gate", and it can never
answer the question a reader is really asking three months later: **has anyone else since pulled
this record out of the store, run it, and had it work.** That second question is the one that
decides whether a record is worth keeping, and nothing in the schema recorded it — so a config that
has been recalled six times and failed six times looked exactly like one nobody had ever tried.

This module adds that ledger, under `value.attestations`, in one vocabulary both lanes use:

    recalls          how many times this record was pulled and actually PUT ON A BOX
    validations      of those, how many reproduced a win   <- the retire signal
    failures         of those, how many ran but did not win
    not_reproduced   of those, how many could not be made to run at all
    last_outcome / last_at / last_by     the most recent attempt, for a reader in a hurry
    history          the last HISTORY_LIMIT attempts with their evidence

`recalls` counts ATTEMPTS ON HARDWARE, not reads. A record that a resolve listed in its top-N and
nobody benched has learned nothing about itself, and counting that as a recall would make the ratio
`validations / recalls` — the only number a retire pass can act on — decay for records that were
never actually doubted.

WHY THIS IS NOT RETRACTION, even though both rewrite a session document in place. Retraction
declares a record FALSE and therefore has to move it: it zeroes the ranking scalars and re-points
the champion, because a flag alone is inert against a reader that ranks on `knowledge.<metric>`
(see kb/retract.py). An attestation declares nothing. One failure on one box is evidence, not a
verdict — the box may have a different ROCm, the flag may have been renamed upstream, the workload
may be off the point the record was tuned for. So this module touches NO ranking scalar and NEVER
re-points the champion. Deciding that an accumulated ledger has become damning, and calling
`retract_session` on the strength of it, is a separate act by a separate caller, which is exactly
the separation that makes the counters trustworthy as input to it.

Rewrites go through the same `mode="replace"` path both planes' `write()` already use, and reuse
`kb/retract.py:existing_files` so a local rewrite re-supplies the artifacts it would otherwise
delete.
