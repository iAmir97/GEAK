"""Curation shared by both lanes' readers: collapsing a ranked candidate list to one rank per idea.

The store ranks on a scalar; the reader wants breadth. Three implementations of one `direction`
are one idea offered three times, and every candidate a lane adopts costs a full on-box verify, so
the runners-up ride along as `alternates` instead of each taking a slot. An entry with no direction
is its own group — unlabeled is honest, not a group.
