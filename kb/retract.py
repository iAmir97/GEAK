"""Retraction for the knowledge base: how a record that turned out to be false is taken back.

The KB Store service exposes no DELETE. Nothing written to it can be removed, and both lanes'
writers say so in their prompts, deliberately. That is not the same as "a wrong record is forever
authoritative", and the difference is this module.

`put_knowledge(..., mode="replace")` rewrites a whole session document in place, and both planes'
`write()` already use that mode. A session id is a deterministic digest of the record's content, so
any record we wrote can be addressed again later without having kept a note of it. Retraction is
therefore a REWRITE to a tombstone, not a deletion: the page still holds a session with that id,
but the session now says "this was wrong, here is why".

**A flag alone would be inert.** Ranking on both planes reads a single top-level scalar
(`knowledge.<metric>`), and `sessions/top?metric=` is what a reader pages through. A document whose
`retained` is false but whose `speedup` still says 1.9 keeps its place at the head of the list for
every consumer that has not been taught the flag — including the service's own rollup. So a
retraction has to do three things at once, and doing two of them is worse than doing none:

  1. mark the document (`retained: false` + a `retired_reason` a human can act on),
  2. drop the ranking scalars below every promote floor, so it sinks in the ordering itself,
  3. re-point the identity's champion, because the champion pointer is a separate object that does
     not re-derive itself from the sessions it points at.

Step 3 is the one that surprises. Zeroing a document does not un-promote it; the champion record
keeps the score it was promoted with, and `champion_speedup()` keeps returning that number as the
bar every future candidate must clear. A retracted champion left in place quietly blocks the page.

What retraction does NOT do: it does not touch the artifacts. The bytes are what let someone audit
the claim afterwards, which is precisely what you want when a record has just been called false.
