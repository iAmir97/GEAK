"""Canonical ids for both workflows, and the fallback ladders that make a miss recoverable.

One file rather than two because the failure this guards against is silent. The `geak` scheme is
CLIENT-DEFINED: the service declares no dimensions for it, does EXACT canonical-id lookup only
(`POST /v1/kb/search` answers `search_unsupported`), and a GET that misses by one segment returns a
plain 404 that is indistinguishable from "nothing was ever recorded here". The API doc says what
that costs, in as many words:

    同一个 kernel 用不同维度个数或顺序描述,会落在不同的 rollup 上,服务端无法把这种情况和
    「两个不同的 kernel」区分开,症状是历史凭空消失。

A reader and a writer that disagree by one segment therefore do not raise — the run just cold
starts and nobody finds out. So both sides of both workflows build their address here, and nowhere
else.

Two schemes, distinguished by the domain segment right after `geak`:

    kernel   geak:kernel:{gfx}:{kernel_name}:{backend}:rocm[:{version}]
    e2e      geak:e2e:{model}:{gfx}:{framework}:{version}:{precision}[:tp_N[:isl_N:osl_N:conc_N]]

Ordering is by how badly a mismatch hurts, most damaging first, because a canonical id can only be
truncated from the RIGHT. That is what makes the tail droppable and the head mandatory:

  * `gfx` leads because an arch mismatch is the nastiest failure mode available. A gfx942-tuned
    patch compiles clean on gfx950 and is simply slower — no error, just a wasted round.
  * `kernel_name` and `backend` next: get either wrong and the patch does not apply at all, which
    at least fails loudly.
  * the ROCm version last, because 7.2 -> 7.3 usually keeps a patch applicable. It is the one
    dimension worth being able to drop.

`producer` is deliberately NOT a dimension, unlike upstream's `kernel:` scheme. It has exactly one
value on our side, and it is not lost by leaving it out: the service stamps it on every record and
the artifact prefix is `kb/<producer>/<session_id>/`. Keeping it would only cost a segment. The
consequence to accept is that dropping the leading segments no longer yields a native `kernel:` id
verbatim, so widening the credential later means running a conversion rather than a prefix rewrite.

THE LADDER IS WRITTEN, NOT COMPUTED. The service does no prefix aggregation — "rollup" there means
the session index under one exact canonical id (`rollup 没有自己的 uuid,直接用 canonical_id
寻址`), and no endpoint takes a prefix or depth. A coarse rung answers a read only if somebody
wrote it. So `canonical_ids()` returns every rung, most specific first, and writers must publish to
ALL of them unconditionally. Publishing conditionally is worse than not publishing: the coarse page
becomes a biased subset of runs and ranks worse than an empty one.

The rungs share one session id, fingerprinted from the MOST SPECIFIC rung, so a measurement is
recognisably one thing at every address it appears. That sharing does NOT make the extra rungs free
on the wire: artifacts live under `kb/<producer>/<session_id>/` and the storage really is shared,
but the file MANIFEST is per (canonical_id, session_id), so a rung that skips put_files reports
file_count 0 and downloads a bundle with no patch in it. Every rung uploads. What the shared id buys
is that the bytes land on the same keys, not that they are sent once.

Stdlib only, like its siblings, so a lane agent can reach it over Bash.
